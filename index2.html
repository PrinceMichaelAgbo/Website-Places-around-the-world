        My Journey all over the World has been with my friends.
        It has changed me in profound ways and I want to use this medium to share my experience.
       </p>

        First, these are the continents I've been to:
       <ul>
         <li>Africa</li>
         <li>Australia</li>
         <li>Asia</li>
         <li>Europe</li>
         <li>North America</li>
         <li>South America</li>
       </ul>
        That is, I've been to all the continents except Antartica.

       <h3>Anyways, I really think that travelling has taught me how to appreciate the vast world we live in,
       enjoy the beauty of life and recognize that even though we have limited time to live, travelling is one
       of the many ways to make the best of it.</h3>
       <p>
          <h3> Travelling with my friends enabled me to strenghthen the bonds I have with them and get to know them
          and myself better. Since we were well prepared, we did not experience the mishaps that accompany odl wives
          tales of travelling like being stranded or having our belongings stolen. There is the indescribable feeling of freedom
          that accompanies travelling and is an experience I would surely recommend for everyone.</h3>
